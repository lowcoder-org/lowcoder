  title: Conversations API Collections
  description: >-
    The conversations APIs enable you to manage and interact with the
    conversations inbox, channels, and messages. For example, you can use these
    APIs to:


    - Get and sort conversations inboxes, channels, threads, and messages.
        
    - Update thread statuses.
        
    - Delete and restore threads.
        
    - Send outbound messages via existing conversations channels.
        
    - Send an internal comment to an agent.
        
    - Retrieve conversation data to create advanced reports and analytics in
    external tools.
        

    You could also use these APIs to integrate existing channels with other apps
    such as
    [Slack](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/how-do-i-use-the-slack-integration)
    or Microsoft Teams to send replies or receive notifications.


    To get started with the conversations APIs, make sure you have [set up a
    HubSpot developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started) and
    [created an app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app).
    You will need a developer account ID and app ID to get access to these APIs.

You also acknowledge and understand the risk associated with testing an unstable API.\n\nThe conversations APIs enable you to manage and interact with the conversations inbox, channels, and messages. For example, you can use these APIs to:\n\n- Get and sort conversations inboxes, channels, threads, and messages.\n    \n- Update thread statuses.\n    \n- Delete and restore threads.\n    \n- Send outbound messages via existing conversations channels.\n    \n- Send an internal comment to an agent.\_\n    \n- Retrieve conversation data to create advanced reports and analytics in external tools.\n    \n\nYou could also use these APIs to integrate existing channels with other apps such as\_[Slack](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/how-do-i-use-the-slack-integration)\_or Microsoft Teams to send replies or receive notifications.\_\n\nTo get started with the conversations APIs, make sure you have\_[set up a HubSpot developer account](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started)\_and\_[created an app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app).

You also cannot start a new thread in an existing channel or connect a 3rd party chat provider to the inbox.\_\n\nTo view all available endpoints and their requirements, click the\_Endpoints\_tab at the top of this article.\n\nWebhooks for conversations are also supported and can be used in tandem with the conversations API. You can use webhooks to\_subscribe to events about conversations, including thread creation, thread status and assignment changes, and new messages on threads.\_Learn more about using\_[webhooks](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/webhooks).\_\n\n**Please note:**\_to make a\_`GET`\_request to any endpoints, or\_`POST`\_batch read request to the get actors endpoint, you must have\_`conversations.read`\_access.\_All other endpoints require\_`conversations.write`\_access."

  - name: Conversations Visitor Identification API
    description: "Use the Visitor Identification API to identify visitors to your site that were authenticated using your own external authentication system.\_An identification token returned from this API can be used to pass information about your already-authenticated visitor to the chat widget, so that it treats the visitor as a known contact. Agents in the inbox can then have confidence about who they are talking to, and visitors can access previous thread history across devices. For example:\n\n**Please note:**\n\n- The Visitor Identification API is for telling HubSpot who the visitor is. You should not rely on this to authenticate users in your platform.\n    \n- Access to the Visitor Identification API requires a\__Professional_\_or\__Enterprise_\_level subscription. If the account does not have a qualifying subscription, you will receive a\_`403`\_error response from the API."
