#### Properties of the Dropdown components <a href="#properties-of-the-table" id="properties-of-the-table"></a>

These properties are accessible in \{{ \}} notations, as well as in JavaScript Queries.

<table><thead><tr><th width="175.97265625">Property Name</th><th width="114.05859375">Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>data</td><td>Array</td><td>Returns the data of the Scanner component</td></tr><tr><td>disabled</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Returns True or False based on whether the Scanner component is disabled or not</td></tr><tr><td>hidden</td><td>Boolean</td><td>Returns True or False based on whether the Scanner component is hidden or not</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Events <a href="#events" id="events"></a>

Events give you the ability to trigger further actions (with Event-Handlers).

<table><thead><tr><th width="166.04296875">Event Name</th><th width="458.8515625">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Click</td><td>Triggers, when a User clicks on the Scanner component</td></tr><tr><td>Success</td><td>Triggers, when the Scanner component successfully scans a QR code</td></tr><tr><td>Close</td><td>Triggers, when Scanner component closes</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Methods <a href="#methods" id="methods"></a>

You have the capability to engage with components via their respective methods, which can be accessed by their designated names within any segment where JavaScript is utilized. Additionally, these components can be activated through the 'Control Component' action, which is triggered in response to specific events.

**setData() :**&#x20;

scanner1.setData(); method sets the Scanner component's Data property.

```javascript
scanner1.setData(["https://www.google.com","https://www.facebook.com"]);
```

**clearData() :**&#x20;

scanner1.clearData() clears the Scanner component's Data property and empties the Data from the Scanner component.

```javascript
scanner1.clearData();
```

**resetData() :**&#x20;

scanner1.resetData() method resets the Scanner component's Data property to the default Data of the Scanner component.

```javascript
scanner1.resetData();
```

### üìå Use Cases

* **Inventory Management**: Scan product barcodes to retrieve or update inventory information.
* **Event Check-Ins**: Validate attendee tickets by scanning QR codes at entry points.
* **Secure Access**: Authenticate users or grant access to restricted areas through code scanning.
* **Product Information**: Provide detailed product information by scanning codes on packaging.
