In Lowcoder, the **Tree** and **Tree Select** components are designed to display and interact with hierarchical data structures, providing users with intuitive navigation and selection capabilities.îˆ†

**Tree Component:**

* **Hierarchical Display:** Presents data in a tree-like structure, allowing users to expand and collapse nodes to explore nested items.
* **Customisation:** Supports customisation of node labels, icons, and styles to align with application requirements.
* **Event Handling:** Offers event handlers for interactions such as node selection, expansion, and collapse, enabling dynamic responses to user actions.

**Tree Select Component:**

* **Dropdown Hierarchy:** Combines the hierarchical display of the Tree component with a dropdown interface, allowing users to select options from nested categories within a compact UI element.
* **Search Functionality:** Includes a search feature to help users quickly locate specific nodes within the hierarchy.
* **Multiple Selection:** Can be configured to allow single or multiple selections based on application needs.
