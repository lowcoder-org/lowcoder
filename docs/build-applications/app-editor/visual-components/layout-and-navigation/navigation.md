**Key Features:**

1. **Menu Creation:** Design hierarchical navigation menus for desktop applications and flat navigation structures for mobile apps, accommodating different user interface requirements.&#x20;
2. **Dynamic and Static Menus:** Construct menus manually or generate them dynamically using data queries, providing flexibility in menu management.&#x20;
3. **App Integration:** Aggregate multiple app screens into a cohesive, multi-page application, allowing seamless transitions between different sections.&#x20;
4. **Customisation:** Tailor menu items by selecting associated apps, customizing labels, and choosing icons to align with the application's design and functionality.&#x20;
5. **Submenu Support:** For desktop applications, create nested submenu items to establish a clear hierarchy within the navigation structure.&#x20;
6. **Parameter Passing:** Append URL query or hash parameters to menu items, enabling the transfer of specific data or states between app screens.&#x20;
7. **Permissions Management:** Control the visibility of menu items based on user permissions, ensuring that users only access authorised sections of the application.
