# Table

The Standard Table is a highly functional and feature-rich component. It is recommended for Server-Side paging and filtering when data display for tables needs many individual settings.

The Lowcoder Table supports auto-size as a component as well as fixed size, where the Header and Toolbar can be fixed when the Table-Body is scrollable.
