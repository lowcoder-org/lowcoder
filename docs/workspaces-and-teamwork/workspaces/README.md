# Workspaces

Lowcoder supports Workspaces. These are isolated rooms to organize:

* User-Groups
* Users
* [Data Sources](../../connect-your-data/data-source-basics/)
* [Predefined Data Queries](../query-library.md)
* [Apps](../../build-applications/create-a-new-app/) & App Folders
* [Themes](../../build-applications/themes-and-styling/)
* Global includes (Javascript / CSS)

**You can use Workspaces when you want to have an isolation of Lowcoder for Teams, Divisions, or Tenants of a single Lowcoder Instance.**

Lowcoder offers the configuration of the Workspaces Behaviour. Two modes are supported:

* Single Workspace Mode (_ENTERPRISE Mode_)
* Multi Workspace Mode (_SAAS Mode_)

{% hint style="info" %}
To activate a multi-workspace configuration, please add the [ENV Variable](https://github.com/lowcoder-org/lowcoder/tree/main/deploy/docker#configuration): **LOWCODER\_WORKSPACE\_MODE**=SAAS
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
From Version 2.3.3, you can add the [ENV Variable](https://github.com/lowcoder-org/lowcoder/tree/main/deploy/docker#configuration) **LOWCODER\_CREATE\_WORKSPACE\_ON\_SIGNUP** to control the behavior of your users (Member role) on self-hosted installation.\
\
true - members can use their own workspace when they sign up. \
false - members will not have their own workspace when they sign up.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to close the possibility that anyone can Sign in and create an account, you can set the ENV Variable **LOWCODER\_EMAIL\_SIGNUP\_ENABLED** to "false". \
\
The Sign In / Sign Up Screen will still be shown, but the Sign Up will return an Error message and new users cannot create Accounts.\
\
This can be helpful if you have your own Identity / OAuth Provider listed and want to be sure that users only with these Identity / OAuth Providers can create Accounts on your Lowcoder installation.
{% endhint %}

The Workspace is a tool to use for organizing groups or user access to Apps. It is also used to apply a theme to a set of Apps.

In the public Lowcoder Cloud, the amount of Workspaces is limited to 10.

In the upper right corner, at the profile, you can find the possibility to switch between your Workspaces.

### Apps & App Folders

[In Lowcoder, you can create Apps. Each App represents what you can create on a single Screen. Often, a complete application consists of multiple Apps. You can then organize these relationships in App Folders or separate them by Workspaces.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

### Themes

You can create multiple [Themes](../../build-applications/themes-and-styling/) for your apps and select a style theme for each app individually. However, each Workspace has its own collection of Themes.

### Global Includes

It is possible to include global CSS styles to fine-tune the visuals of Apps. Also, it may be necessary to include a Javascript script, which is executed for all Apps of a Workspace. With the help of global includes, you can achieve  Workspace.

### Further administrative Settings

On self-hosted installations, you can set up thresholds for workspaces with the help of [ENV Variables](https://github.com/lowcoder-org/lowcoder/tree/main/deploy/docker#configuration)&#x20;

* **LOWCODER\_MAX\_ORGS\_PER\_USER**
  * Sets the default maximum number of Workspaces that a single user (as Admin) can create. This limit ensures that users can manage a reasonable number of organizations without overwhelming your installation.
  * **Default Value**: 100
* **LOWCODER\_MAX\_MEMBERS\_PER\_ORG**
  * Defines the default maximum number of members (including users and roles) allowed in a single Workspace.&#x20;
  * **Default Value**: 1000
* **LOWCODER\_MAX\_GROUPS\_PER\_ORG**
