# App Usage Logs Feature

While **Audit Logs** help you track **what your teams and app editors do** _within_ the Lowcoder platform, the **App Usage Logs** feature shifts focus outward‚Äîcapturing **how your published apps are consumed by real users**.

Think of it as a lightweight, embedded **analytics suite**, similar to Google Analytics‚Äîbut tailored for internal tools and enterprise apps built on Lowcoder.

**App Usage Logs** deliver actionable insights into **how your applications are used by end-users**. Whether those users are employees, customers, or external partners, this feature gives you the visibility needed to understand:

* Which apps are used most
* Who is using them (anonymous or logged-in)
* From where, and on what kind of devices
