# Environment Details

On Environments page, we have a list of the Environments that you have configured on the Enterprise Edition. All Environment use the same PostgreSQL DB, but each of these have a separate MongoDB. What this means is that "Needed to be written".

**Management/Deployment of the Resources :**&#x20;

Without "Mange" toggle ON, Admin can't deploy an item across environments. So, to enable "Deployment", first Admin need to turn ON the "Manage" toggle. After that, Click on "Deploy" button and it will show a pop up, asking for following three things :&#x20;

1. Choose the Target Environment/s
2. Checkmark the "Dependencies" Updates if needed
3. Make the App Public to All or Marketplace

After clicking the "Deploy" button, the app will get deployed to selected Environment. Same flow happens to Data Sources and Data Queries section.
