# Audit Logs

Audit-Logs are essential for teams that require **security visibility**, **compliance readiness**, and **operational accountability** ‚Äî especially when managing multiple environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).

Audit Logs provide a **detailed record** of everything that Users do in your Lowcoder environment. They help you:

* **Trace Lowcoder App Developer behavior** for security monitoring
* **Meet compliance standards** (e.g., SOC2, ISO27001)
* **Investigate changes or issues** with full contextual data
* **Understand how apps and resources are being managed**
