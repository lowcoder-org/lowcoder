# Lowcoder Enterprise Edition

Lowcoder Enterprise Edition extends the power of Lowcoder with advanced capabilities designed for teams managing complex applications and needing more control, customisation, compliance, and scalability. It brings full control, transparency, and flexibility to your development lifecycle — all without the overhead of traditional DevOps setups.

Unlike the public cloud version (Community Edition) hosted at [app.lowcoder.cloud](https://app.lowcoder.cloud), the Enterprise Edition can be deployed only on your private infrastructure (self-hosted) or hosted securely by Lowcoder.

### Easy to install.

Just add the Enterprise Edition Plugin to your existing Lowcoder installation without any further changes. By adding the Plugin- and License-Files to your existing Lowcoder Environment, you can activate the additional functionality. You can try Lowcoder Enterprise Edition without risk. If you no longer want it, just remove the Plugin-File. All will work as before too. Lowcoder Enterprise Edition does not change the Configuration or Files on your regular installation.

#### Environments & Staging Deployments

Managing modern apps often involves far more than just the development itsel. In Lowcoder, apps are connected to Workspaces, Sharing and Publishing states, User Access Rights, Data Sources, and Queries, making Git-based deployment too limited and error-prone.

Instead, Lowcoder offers **seamless UI-driven staging and production workflows**:

* **Selective deployment**: Only promote the Apps, Queries, or Data Sources that are marked as "managed".
* **Dependency awareness**: Automatically deploy or connect referenced objects across environments.
* **Multi-stage support**: Safely deploy from Dev to Staging to Production with full clarity.

When you're working across development, QA, and live environments and want to **control exactly what goes live**, without manually syncing objects or worrying about broken links.

***

#### Full Branding & White-Label Customization

Lowcoder Enterprise allows complete customization of the platform:

* Change logos, colors, and fonts
* Customize sign-up pages, error messages, and embedded documentation links
* Deliver a **fully white-labeled experience** to your users or internal teams

This is for you, if you’re offering Lowcoder to clients or internal stakeholders, and want it to **look and feel like your product**, not a third-party tool.

***

#### Audit Logging with Before/After Tracking

It is essential to stay compliant and secure with a full **activity history** of Admins and App-Editors across all Lowcoder actions:

* Tracks every change by every user
* Captures **before and after states** of all modified objects
* Useful for audits, incident analysis, and regulatory compliance

When operating in regulated environments (e.g. finance, healthcare, or enterprise IT) or when your organization needs **traceability and accountability** for changes.

***

#### App Usage Logs — Built-in Analytics

With the build in analytics, you can understand how your apps are used:

* Track page views, user sessions, and interactions
* See which apps are used most — and when
* This is a lightweight, privacy-respecting alternative to tools like Google Analytics

With Lowcoder Analytics, you can monitor app adoption, **optimize UX**, or **track business value** — all without leaving Lowcoder.

Lowcoder Enterprise is built for organizations that demand more: more control, more visibility, more integration. Whether you're building apps for clients, employees, or regulated use cases, Enterprise equips you with the tools to deploy, manage, and govern at scale — with no DevOps required
