# Native embed SDK

The key advantage for React developers using Lowcoder is the ease of embedding Lowcoder apps directly into the React component hierarchy. This native integration means that Lowcoder apps can be treated as part of the React tree, ensuring a smooth and cohesive user experience. Developers can place Lowcoder apps within their existing React components, maintaining the structural and stylistic consistency of their applications.

Moreover, the interaction between React components and Lowcoder apps is exceptionally fluid. React developers can directly manipulate the state of Lowcoder apps, invoke methods, and handle events, creating a highly interactive and responsive environment. This direct interaction is a game-changer, as it allows for real-time data exchange and dynamic behavior within the application.

For instance, a React developer can easily update the state of a Lowcoder app based on user interactions or external data changes in their React components. This two-way communication ensures that the embedded Lowcoder apps are not just static elements but integral, interactive parts of the overall application.

The ability to interact with Lowcoder apps through state management, method calls, and event handling in React also simplifies the development process. Developers can leverage their existing knowledge of React's ecosystem to control and customize Lowcoder apps, reducing the learning curve and accelerating development timelines.

## Event Handler & Trigger

Event Handlers enable Application Creators to use visually guided Handler Creation for Events that may occur in Visual Components. Use these Event handlers to trigger Events and ensure a good UI.

The event handler itself does not contain any application logic. It manages only the display of the Event handler. For you as Developer, you can use them to prepare a good visual user interface for Application Creators.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/App Editor  Event Handlers.webp" alt=""><figcaption><p>Meeting related Event Handlers. Developers can bind logical triggers in their component code to this visual Event Handlers.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Importing Event Handlers

To utilize an event handler, first import it from the designated module:

```javascript
import { InputEventHandlerControl } from "path/to/eventHandlerControl";
```

You can then attach this handler directly to component events or use intermediary functions for specific user actions.

### Using Event Handlers

A typical use of event handlers is in combination with the childrenmap of a component.

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">const childrenMap = {
    ... 
    onEvent: InputEventHandlerControl,
    ...
}

// other code

return new UICompBuilder(childrenMap, (props: { 
    ... 
    onFocus: () => props.onEvent("focus"),
    onBlur: () => props.onEvent("blur"),
<strong>    onPressEnter: () => props.onEvent("submit"),
</strong>    ...
}) => {
...
