Dear Community,

We are excited to announce a new initiative to support and extend Openblocks and Lowcoder. 

OpenFlower will be a fully open source, accessible to all, and free from any restrictions or limitations under Mozilla Public License, version 2.0. 

OpenFlower commits to the community, maintenance, bug fixes, and feature development in an new Product Roadmap. 

We plan to introduce new features and enhancements. 

We invite all members of the community to join us on this journey. Whether you are a user, contributor, or enterprise customer, your input and support are critical to the success of Lowcoder. Let's work together to keep this project alive and thriving for many years to come.

Sincerely,

OpenFlower Team
