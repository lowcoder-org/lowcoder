## 📢 Use Lowcoder in 3 steps
1. Connect to any data sources or APIs.
2. Build UI with 50+ components.
3. Share with colleagues and customers.

## 💡 Why Lowcoder
It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.

Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.

NewGen Lowcode Platforms like Retool and others are great for their simplicity and flexibility - like Lowcoder too, but they can also be limited in different ways, especially when it comes to "external" applications for everyone.

Lowcoder wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Lowcoder is:
- An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing (external) apps.
- A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
- The tool and community to support your business, and lower the cost and time to develop interactive applications.
- The only platform to embed Lowcode Apps natively in Websites (no iFrame!)
- The only platform where you can build your own Meeting Tool - like Teams, Zoom or Google Meets, - just in the Lowcode way.
